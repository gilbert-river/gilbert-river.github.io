title: Groundwater
permalink: /grap/groundwater/
excerpt: Groundwater is an important resource in the GRAP, with bores being used for stock and domestic use and a limited number of spear bores accessing water stored in the bedsands of the Gilbert River. Along with surface water, groundwater could be used to expand irrigated agriculture in the region.

Groundwater includes any water that is held underground and stored in the soil or within the pores and crevices of rocks. The substrate is called an aquifer when it contains or transmits groundwater. There are often layers of aquifers underneath the ground, differentiated by respective characteristics defined by their geological formations. The layered aquifers may or may not interact with each other. 

# Groundwater system in the Gilbert catchment and the GRAP

The groundwater system in the Gilbert catchment and the GRAP is that of alluvial sediments overlaying a deeper groundwater system, with little connection between the aquifers.

The alluvial aquifers are most prevalent in current and old riverbeds, often forming localised groundwater systems. The Gilbert River bed sands are such a system. Yields from the bed sands are suitable to support irrigation, with an example being the use of water entitlements extracted from the bed sands to support a mango plantation along the Gilbert River. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some spear bores will run dry towards the end of the dry season while others have abundant water all year round.    

There are several underlying aquifers/groups of aquifers including the Bulimba Formation, Rolling Down Group, Gilbert River Formation and Eulo Queen Group. The yields for these aquifers is too low to support irrigated agriculture directly and would have to be used in conjunction with temporary storage.

# Groundwater use in the GRAP

Groundwater use in the GRAP is divided into bores that access below surface aquifers and spear bores that access the bed sands of the Gilbert River. 

Several properties hold entitlements to extract water from the Gilbert River bed sands via spear bores throughout the GRAP; five entitlement exist in total. Although water is extracted from the alluvial aquifer that underlies the Gilbert River, this water is classed as surface water and is managed under the Water Plan (Gulf) 2007 <sup>1</sup>. 

The majority of registered bores in the GRAP (and Gilbert generally) have a registered use of stock and/or domestic purposes and do not require an associated entitlement. There is only one bore that has an authorised use for irrigation/aquaculture purposes; it has an entitlement of 13 ML per water year and is described as accessing the Gilbert River Formation. Management of these bores falls under the Water Plan (Great Artesian Basin and Other Regional Aquifers) 2017 <sup>2</sup>.
