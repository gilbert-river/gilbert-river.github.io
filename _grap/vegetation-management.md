excerpt: Development needs to ensure high value land is cared for. While landholders often care for the land themselves, government also imposes specific land clearing rules.

Vegetation management rules are often seen as red tape, but they are also a means to an end, intended to help maintain biodiversity, prevent land degradation, protect vegetation that we value, and control deforestation.

Alongside areas of environmental significance where clearing is heavily regulated, all vegetation in the state of Queensland is categorized to describe what level of clearing, if any, is allowed.
The categories present in the Gilbert catchment are outlined below:
- Category A areas are declared areas, offset areas, exchange areas or areas that have been subject to unlawful clearing. Clearing cannot occur in these areas.  
- Category B areas are comprised of remnant vegetation and can only be thinned via a development approval. 
- Category C areas are comprised of high-value regrowth vegetation. Clearing can occur for fodder harvesting, managing non-native plants or declared weeds and managing encroachment.
- Category X areas are not regulated by vegetation laws and can be readily cleared

Before a landholder clears any (additional) land on their property, they should apply for a <a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/management/vegetation/maps/map-correction" target="_blank">property map of assessable vegetation (PMAV)</a>. Once a PMAV is certified, it overrides the regulated vegetation management map for determining the different vegetation categories of a property. A PMAV can also amend the state wide vegetation mapping if an error can be proved. A <a href="https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0017/111095/pmav-application-form.pdf" target="_blank">PMAV Application Form</a> and associated application fee have to be supplied to the Department of Resources. The Department of Resources have compiled a <a href="https://www.resources.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/1580058/pmav-application-guide.pdf" target="_blank">PMAV Application Guide</a> to assist landholders in making a PMAV application. Section 20C to 20HC of the <a href="https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-1999-090" target="_blank">Vegetation Management Act 1999</a> relate to applications of a PMAV by a landholder.
