excerpt: Erosion is a natural process where soil or rock is removed. Erosion can be accelerated by human activities (e.g., grazing, agriculture). Erosion is a current problem in the Gilbert catchment and should be addressed before any further land use change.

Erosion occurs when soil (or another substrate) is removed by water, wind or another natural agent. Erosion can occur on natural land, grazing land or <a href="https://www.tucson.ars.ag.gov/isco/isco13/PAPERS%20A-E/CAREY.pdf" target="_blank">cropping land</a>. There are many methods to <a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/management/soil/erosion/management" target="_blank">prevent erosion or mitigate where erosion has occured</a>.

# Erosion in the Gilbert catchment 

There is evidence of erosion currently occurring in the Gilbert catchment. 
Some areas suffer from gullying<sup>1</sup>, including Rockdale and Namuel. Rockdale suffers from sodic soils that 'dissolve when they get wet'. These gullies are old (>40 years) and once they start it is almost impossible to stop gullies from extending and remediating them. One farmer spoken to as part of the <a href="/about/">QWMN Gilbert Digital Twin project</a> noted you 'have to hope there are some underlying rocks that will stop the erosion'.

Several past studies have focused on erosion in the northern Australian, catchments that flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria and/or the Gilbert River catchment.

Like the neighboring Flinders and Mitchell River catchments, sub-surface (e.g., gully and stream banks) erosion  is the major contributor to sediment loads in the Gilbert catchment <sup>2</sup>. This is because the sub-soils in the area are <a href="https://www.qld.gov.au/environment/land/management/soil/soil-properties/sodicity#:~:text=Sodicity%20in%20soil%20is%20the,of%20sodium%20impacts%20soil%20structure." target="_blank">sodic</a> in nature. Sub-surface erosion was not assessed as part of the CSIRO's FGARA analysis, meaning that the soil suitability classes developed as part of FGARA could be overly optimistic.

To reduce the threat of catalysing gully erosion or worsening current erosion, it has been suggested to buffer all drainage lines and existing gullies when moving from grazing to intensified land use (e.g., irrigated agriculture). If required intensive gully rehabilitation could also be undertaken before land use conversion, however, this is associated with a significant cost.   

Besides continual erosion experienced in the region (Gilbert and surrounding catchments), erosion events are associated with large monsoonal troughs. After a large monsoonal trough hit the area in 2019, a erosion assessment was undertaken in the area<sup>1</sup>. This study identified both gully and streambank erosion in GRAP area.

Sand in the <a href="/grap/gilbert-river/">Gilbert River</a> has been observed by landholders to be increasing. This is likely to be driven by erosion processes, as well as patterns of sand mobilisation and deposition within the river itself. 

## Land use changes and erosion risk 

Land use changes can also change erosion risk. Changing from a grazing system to a cropping system could result in an increase in bare soil that is susceptible to erosion. However, with good management (e.g., minimum or zero tillage as opposed to intensive tillage and subtle retention) erosion risk can be minimised in cropping systems . This is particularly important in monsonal systems like the Gilbert where large rainfall events are common throughout the wet season. Another way to limit erosion is to retain riparian vegetation along watercourses as a way to stabilise banks.
