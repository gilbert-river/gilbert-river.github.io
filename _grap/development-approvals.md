A development application is an application for a development approval made under the <a href="https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/pdf/inforce/current/act-2016-025" target="_blank">Planning Act 2016</a>. Development approval is required for building dams and other changes associated with establishing irrigated agriculture. 

There is one main development application form (DA Form 1) and several associated forms. The associated forms that are relevant here include:
- Template 2: Taking or interfering with water in a watercourse, lake or spring 
- Template 3: Taking over land flow water
- Template 4: Waterway barrier works
All forms are available on Queensland Government's <a href="https://planning.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/planning-framework/development-assessment/development-assessment-process/forms-and-templates" target="_blank">Planning website</a>. The forms step a proponent through the information needed to complete the application. However, <a href="https://planning.statedevelopment.qld.gov.au/planning-framework/state-assessment-and-referral-agency" target="_blank">State Assessment and Referral Agency (SARA)</a> can be contacted to gain guidance and advice on the needs of a development application.
