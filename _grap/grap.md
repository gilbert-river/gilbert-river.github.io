excerpt: The Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (GRAP) incorporates the properties along the Gilbert River between Green Hills and Strathmore Station. This area has been highlighted as having potential for broadscale irrigated agriculture based on soil properties and water availability, but development is currently limited to production of some horticultural crops and early investments in irrigated broadacre crops.

The Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (GRAP) is comprised of the properties that border or are adjacent to the Gilbert River from Green hills to Strathmore Station.

The transition of the land within the GRAP from grazing-dominated production to irrigated agriculture has been discussed for many years. As yet, there has been limited investment in irrigated production apart from some established horticultural crops and early broadacre cropping efforts. This is despite the large amount of arable land in the area (10,000 - 25,000 ha<sup>1</sup>). 

The proposed <a href="/grap/green-hills-dam/">Green Hills Dam</a> would service the GRAP. The majority of land in the proposed GRAP are currently pastoral leases, where cattle is grazed on native pastures. However, there is some cropping currently occurring in the area, including mangoes, with many crops (e.g., rice, peanuts, cotton, mung beans, hay) being suggested showing potential in the region. There are current cropping trials occurring the GRAP, including table grapes and cotton among other crops. The CSIRO FGARA project analysed the land suitability of many crops in both the Gilbert and Flinders catchment, with the GRAP highlighted as a more suitable area for many crops than in other parts of the Gilbert catchment.
