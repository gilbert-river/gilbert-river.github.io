title: Surface Water
permalink: /grap/surface-water/
excerpt: Surface water in the north of Australia is influenced by the monsoonal climate, with many water bodies and watercourses being ephemeral. Those that are not ephemeral become refuges for flora and fauna in the dry season and/or watering points for cattle.

Surface water includes streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands, reservoirs, and creeks as well as surface <a href=" /grap/runoff/">runoff</a>. 

<a href="/grap/water-bodies/">Water bodies</a>, including farm dams, waterholes and wetlands, are important in the GRAP and throughout the Gilbert as they store water from the wet into the dry. This provides water for cattle as well as other flora and fauna who seek refugee in water bodies at the height of the dry season. 

<a href="/datasources/watercourse-lines/">Watercourses</a> (rivers, streams and creeks, etc) throughout the Gilbert catchment and the GRAP are fed by <a href="/grap/runoff/">runoff</a> from the land and in some places <a href="/grap/groundwater/">groundwater</a>. As for the <a href="/grap/water-bodies/">Water bodies</a> of the region, the <a href="/grap/water-availability/">monsoonal climate</a> means that many of the watercourses are ephemeral meaning they do not flow all the time. The major watercourse of the GRAP is the <a href="/grap/gilbert-river/">Gilbert River</a>, from which <a href="/grap/gulf-unallocated-water-release/">water is currently available</a> to support <a href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/industries/mining-energy-water/water/catchments-planning/unallocated-water/gulf" target="_blank"> irrigated agriculture and other economic development opportunities</a>.
