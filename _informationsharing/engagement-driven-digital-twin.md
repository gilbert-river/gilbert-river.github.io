A [learning-focused digital twin](/information-sharing/learning-focused-digital-twin/) can be implemented through stakeholder engagement activities, by itself or to complement a [web portal digital twin](/information-sharing/web-portal-digital-twin/). 

This digital twin implements an engagement-driven digital twin through two protocols, [Landholder engagement](/information-sharing/qwmn-landholder-engagement/), using printed visualisations from the digital twin in conversations about water and water management, and [Policy prompt packs](/information-sharing/qwmn-policy-prompt-packs/), involving anonymised cases to facilitate discussion about approval processes.

For stakeholder engagement activities to implement a digital twin, they need to act as an interface to a consistent underlying conceptual model and associated data sources. As described in the [digital twin architecture](/information-sharing/learning-focused-digital-twin/#digital-twin-architecture), protocols draw on a set of visualisations connecting through to concepts and data sources involved, and can contribute information that be added back to the digital twin as part of or after the engagement process. Multiple stakeholder engagement activities can therefore be designed to explicitly engage with overlapping or different parts of the digital twin to reach different audiences.

An engagement-driven digital twin still needs a minimal representation of the [digital twin itself](/information-sharing/self-reference/) in order to ensure consistency with an underlying conceptual model. In contrast to a full web portal, a simple description of concepts and connected data sources may be sufficient, however, e.g. through conceptual diagrams and lists of available data for relevant concepts. An engagement-driven digital twin can therefore provide a low cost entry point to test the potential for a digital twin in a new context and help iteratively refine its scope, conceptual model, users, and use cases.
