A digital twin is a time-varying representation of a system that brings together observed information and predictive model capabilities. It provides a structure within which to accumulate information and understanding, identify uncertainties and gaps, and reason about the value of new information, in addition to reasoning about potential improvements to system operation.

In this project, a digital twin consists of concepts, their relationship to each other, measured or modelled observations of the concepts and visualisations. As a [learning-focused digital twin](/information-sharing/learning-focused-digital-twin/), it also includes a representation of itself and a protocol for [how it should be updated](/information-sharing/digital-twinning/).
