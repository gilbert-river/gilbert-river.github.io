This website is a prototype "[learning-focused digital twin](/information-sharing/learning-focused-digital-twin)", intended to help organise and accumulate knowledge about the Gilbert River Agricultural Precinct (GRAP), focussing on water. Each web page describes what we currently know about a specific topic. The [home page](/) includes direct links to key pages. A list of pages is available about the [GRAP](/grap/) and key [data sources](/datasources/). The content of the digital twin has also been used through [landholder engagement](/information-sharing/qwmn-landholder-engagement/) and [policy prompt packs](/information-sharing/qwmn-policy-prompt-packs/).

The digital twin is intended to complement other forms of formal and informal information sharing.

Rural extension services provide ongoing support for training and information sharing, including through producer days and producer groups.

Talking with neighbours can also provide information about agricultural practices specific to a particular area, including from neighbours who don't like public speaking. "Looking over the fence" is seen as useful.

It is common in the area to call neighbours, e.g. regarding whether roads are likely to be [flooded](/grap/flooding/). The private Facebook group "<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1642256456024346/" target="_blank">Who Got Rain Queensland???</a>" is also commonly used.

Consultants and other water supply and irrigation service providers are generally based outside the region, but may have regular visits.
