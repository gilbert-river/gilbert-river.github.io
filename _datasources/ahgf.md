The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (Geofabric) registers the spatial relationships between important hydrological features such as rivers, water bodies, aquifers and monitoring points.

We use it for spatial data describing:
- [Watersheds](/grap/watershed/): Geofabric Surface Catchments (*AHGFCatchment*) defines a catchment for every stream segment contained within Geofabric Surface Network (*AHGFNetworkStream*) according to the 1 second DEM.

AHGF also provides spatial data for:
- [Stream network](/grap/stream-network)
- [Stream gauges](/datasources/stream-gauges/)
- [Water bodies](/grap/water-bodies/), including [farm dams](/grap/farm-dams/)
