# Bureau of Meteorology flood warning system for the Gilbert River

The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) operates a flood warning system for the Gilbert River catchment. The system combines observations from on the ground volunteers, who report when pre-determined flood heights are exceeded at their property, and several automatic telemetry stations throughout the catchment. Information about past floods is also available.

Warning from the system are broadcast on radio stations, through BOM websites, and via local response organisations. Local organisations in and around Georgetown include:
- State Emergency Service (SES) (Gulf Developmental Road, Georgetown): (07) 4062 1122
- Police (High Street, Georgetown): (07) 4062 1209
- Queensland Fire and Emergency Services (SES Building, Gulf Development Road, Georgetown)

Anecdotally, many of the small tributaries of the major rivers that are not monitored as part of the telemetry network can flood quickly and without warning.
