title: Digital Earth Australia Water Observations
excerpt: Mapping of surface water areas since 1986 at 30m resolution, showing when the Gilbert River flows, flooding, and water in large water bodies
---

This dataset shows where [surface water](/grap/surface-water/) was observed within each available individual Landsat satellite image since mid 1986. Each 30m pixel is classified as ‘wet’, ‘dry’ or ‘invalid’. Summary statistics show where water is usually, and where it is rarely. This product was previously known as Water Observations From Space (WOfS).

In many places the [Gilbert river](/grap/gilbert-river/) is wide enough for the dataset to show when it is flowing and dry. It may also be able to show [flooding](/grap/flooding/). It may be able to show whether large [water bodies](/grap/water-bodies/), including wetlands and waterholes have permanent water or when they are dry.

Derived datasets are also provided with timeseries showing % area covered by water for mapped waterbodies and wetlands.

Data is not available for every day, and is not available when the area cannot be clearly seen (e.g. due to clouds, shadows, or satellite observation problems), e.g. the January 2009 flood is not visible.
