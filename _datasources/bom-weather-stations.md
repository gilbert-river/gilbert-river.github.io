The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) operates weather stations throughout Australia that collect on the ground data for climate variables including rainfall, temperature and evaporation. Stations can be searched for via BOM's <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/stations/" target="_blank">Weather Station Directory</a>. Alternatively, climate data can be accessed via <a href="https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/silo/point-data/" target="_blank">SILO</a>. Weather stations exist in Georgetown and on several properties throughout the catchment.

There are 13 weather stations within 50 km of Georgetown that currently or have historically measured rainfall. Only 5 of these stations have measurements in the 2021/2022 water year (Georgetown Airport, Mount Turner Station, Green Hills, Riverview and Eveleigh Station). These stations have been active for an average of 46 years with a percent completeness of 85% while active.
